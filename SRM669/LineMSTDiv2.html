Given is an int <b>N</b>.
</p><p>
A <i>complete</i> graph is a graph in which each pair of vertices is connected by exactly one undirected edge.
</p><p>
A graph is called <i>beautiful</i> if:
<ul>
<li>It is a complete graph on <b>N</b> vertices.</li>
<li>Each edge has an associated cost, and each of these costs is either 1 or 2.</li>
</ul>
Hence, there are exactly 2^(<b>N</b>*(<b>N</b>-1)/2) different beautiful graphs.
</p><p>
The <i>minimum spanning tree</i> (MST) of a beautiful graph is its subgraph with the following properties:
<ul>
<li>The subgraph contains all <b>N</b> vertices.</li>
<li>The subgraph is connected. (I.e., it is possible to get from any vertex to any other vertex using only edges that belong to the subgraph.)</li>
<li>The total cost of edges in the subgraph is as small as possible.</li>
</ul>
A single beautiful graph can have multiple MSTs.
(Each of these MSTs will contain a different set of edges, but they will have the same total cost.)
</p><p>
An MST is called a <i>line</i> if the degree of each of its vertices is at most 2.<br></br>
</p><p>
Hibiki likes MSTs.
She also likes lines.
For each beautiful graph G, let f(G) be the number of its MSTs that are lines.
(Note that for some beautiful graphs it may be the case that f(G)=0.)
</p><p>
Let X be the sum of the values f(G) over all beautiful graphs G.
Please calculate X for her.
As X can be very large, compute and return the value (X modulo 1,000,000,007).
